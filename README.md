# Unity-Utility-Scripts
Simple ready to use scripts for game mechanics.
Don't expect high quality from these scripts, as I simply created this repository for quick & easy access to these files.

If a script is within a folder, they **all need** each other to work.
EXAMPLE: The board movement script has the main movement handler + ScriptableObject to set up each path

You are free to use any of these files (not that you should, since they aren't the best quality) and modify as you wish, even contribute to them if you'd like.
